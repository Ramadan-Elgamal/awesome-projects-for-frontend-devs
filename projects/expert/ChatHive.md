# ðŸŽ¯ ChatHive
> A Slack-inspired real-time messaging platform with channels and direct messaging.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Scale: Large
Expected timeline: 2-3 months

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Purpose
ChatHive is a collaborative messaging application where users can join channels or engage in direct messaging. With features for real-time messaging, user presence, and a channel-based structure, ChatHive aims to provide a seamless communication experience for teams and groups. This project focuses on WebSocket integration, user authentication, and state management for user presence.
