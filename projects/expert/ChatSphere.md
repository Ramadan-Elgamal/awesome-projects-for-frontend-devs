# ðŸŽ¯ ChatSphere
> A sleek, real-time chat application for instant communication.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Scale: Large
Expected timeline: 1-2 months

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Purpose
ChatSphere is a real-time messaging app where users can send and receive messages instantly. The app will support WebSocket integration for live messaging, user authentication, and chat history storage, providing a seamless experience for both private and group conversations.

## âš¡ Features Breakdown

### Phase 1 (Essential - Start Here)
- [ ] **User Authentication** - Implement user authentication with Firebase Authentication or an alternative authentication service.
- [ ] **Message Input & Send** - Create an input field for typing and sending messages in real time.
- [ ] **Real-Time Messaging** - Integrate WebSocket (e.g., Socket.io) or Firebase Realtime Database to handle live message exchange between users.
- [ ] **Basic Chat UI** - Develop a chat interface that displays messages with timestamps and differentiates between sent and received messages.

### Phase 2 (Near Future - Next 2-4 weeks)
- [ ] **Message History** - Store and display past messages when users join or refresh the chat.
- [ ] **Typing Indicators** - Show indicators when a user is typing to make the conversation more interactive.

### Phase 3 (Future Expansion)
- [ ] **Message Reactions** - Allow users to react to messages with emojis.
- [ ] **Media Sharing** - Enable users to send images, audio, and video files.

- [ ] **Customizable Themes** - Provide light and dark themes, or let users customize the chat interface.
- [ ] **Search & Message Filtering** - Allow users to search for messages or filter by user/date.

### Libraries to try
- [ ] **Socket.io** - For handling real-time WebSocket connections and messaging.
