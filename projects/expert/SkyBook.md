> Find, compare, and book flights with an interactive seat selection experience.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Scale: Large
Expected timeline: 3+ months

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Purpose
SkyBook is a flight booking platform that allows users to search for flights, filter options, and complete bookings with a guided flow, including seat selection. This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with complex form validation, multi-step processes, and API integration, creating a fully interactive and user-centered application.

## âš¡ Features Breakdown

### Phase 1 (Essential - Start Here)
- [ ] **Flight Search Form** - Implement a search form to let users enter travel details (origin, destination, dates).
- [ ] **Flight Options List** - Display a list of available flights with sorting and filtering options (e.g., price, duration, airlines).
- [ ] **API Integration for Flight Data** - Connect to a flight API (e.g., Amadeus, Skyscanner) to retrieve real-time flight options.

### Phase 2 (Near Future - Next 4-8 weeks)
- [ ] **Detailed Flight Info** - Show a detailed view for each flight with airline information, layovers, and other specifics.

### Phase 3 (Future Expansion)
