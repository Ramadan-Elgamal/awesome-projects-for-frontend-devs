# ðŸŽ¯ SketchIt
> An interactive drawing app with tools for creativity, saving, and loading drawings.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Scale: Medium
Expected timeline: 2-3 weeks

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Purpose
SketchIt is a digital canvas app allowing users to draw, paint, and save their creations. This project introduces basic drawing tools, shape options, color pickers, and functionality to save and reload drawings.

## âš¡ Features Breakdown

### Phase 1 (Essential - Start Here)
- [ ] **Canvas Setup** - Implement a drawing canvas with basic pencil tool.
- [ ] **Color Picker** - Add color selection to change the drawing color.
- [ ] **Brush Sizes** - Let users select brush sizes for different stroke thicknesses.

### Phase 2 (Near Future - Next 1-2 weeks)
- [ ] **Additional Tools** - Add eraser, shape tools (rectangle, circle), and fill options.
- [ ] **Save Drawing** - Allow users to save drawings to local storage or as an image file.
- [ ] **Load Drawing** - Enable users to reload saved drawings.
- [ ] **Undo/Redo Functionality** - Add undo/redo actions for improved user control.
- [ ] **Clear Canvas** - Provide an option to clear the canvas.

### Phase 3 (Future Expansion)
- [ ] **Layers** - Add layers for complex drawings with independent editing.
- [ ] **Advanced Brush Effects** - Introduce brushes with unique textures (e.g., watercolor, pencil).
- [ ] **Customizable Canvas Size** - Allow users to set custom dimensions for their canvas.
- [ ] **Share Feature** - Implement a share option to post creations on social media.

### Libraries to try
- [ ] **Fabric.js** - Simplifies working with HTML5 canvas and provides easy-to-use drawing and saving methods.
- [ ] **html2canvas** - For converting canvas drawings to images for downloading or sharing.
- [ ] **react-color** - Ready-made color pickers to enhance the user experience.
- [ ] **redux-persist** - For saving and restoring drawings across sessions (if using Redux for state management).
