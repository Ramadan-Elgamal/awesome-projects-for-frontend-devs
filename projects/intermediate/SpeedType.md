# ðŸŽ¯ SpeedType
> Test your typing speed and accuracy with dynamic challenges and real-time feedback!

## ðŸ“‹ Project Scale: Medium
Expected timeline: 2-3 weeks

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Purpose
SpeedType helps users measure their typing speed and accuracy by presenting random text passages to type. It provides real-time feedback on typing performance, including words per minute (WPM) and accuracy rate, making it a great tool for typing practice and improvement.

## âš¡ Features Breakdown

### Phase 1 (Essential - Start Here)
- [ ] **Random Text Generation** - Generate a random sentence or paragraph for the typing test.
- [ ] **Real-Time Typing Speed Calculation** - Display typing speed in words per minute (WPM) as the user types.
- [ ] **Accuracy Tracking** - Calculate and display the accuracy percentage based on typed characters versus expected characters.

### Phase 2 (Near Future - Next 2-4 weeks)
- [ ] **Error Highlighting** - Highlight incorrect characters in real-time to help users identify and correct mistakes.
- [ ] **Timer Display** - Add a timer that shows the elapsed time during the test and stops when the test is completed.
- [ ] **Reset and Retry Option** - Allow users to reset and retry the typing test with new random text.
- [ ] **Statistics Summary** - Show a summary at the end of each test, including WPM, accuracy, and error count.

### Phase 3 (Future Expansion)
- [ ] **Typing Test Difficulty Levels** - Add options for different difficulty levels (e.g., easy, medium, hard) with varying text lengths and complexity.
- [ ] **Progress Tracking** - Allow users to save scores and track their progress over time.
- [ ] **Leaderboard** - Implement a leaderboard to compare typing scores with other users.
- [ ] **Custom Text Input** - Allow users to input their own text passages for a personalized typing test.

### Libraries to try
- [ ] **faker.js** - Generate random sentences or paragraphs for typing tests.
- [ ] **react-countdown** - For managing the timer display and countdown functionality.
- [ ] **react-hotkeys** - Handle keyboard events for real-time input tracking and error detection.
- [ ] **react-chartjs-2** - Display progress tracking and statistics with charts.
