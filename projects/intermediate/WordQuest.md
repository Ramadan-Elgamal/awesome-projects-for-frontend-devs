# ðŸŽ¯ Word Quest
> A fun and interactive word guessing game with score tracking and hint system.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Scale: Medium
Expected timeline: 2-3 weeks

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Purpose
Word Quest challenges players to guess a hidden word by providing letters, with each guess tracked for scoring. Hints are offered along the way to keep players engaged and help them discover the word. This project emphasizes game logic, state management, and real-time user interaction.

## âš¡ Features Breakdown
