# ðŸŽ¯ CineList
> A personalized app to create, track, and manage your ultimate movie watchlist.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Scale: Medium
Expected timeline: 2-3 weeks

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Purpose
CineList allows movie enthusiasts to create and manage a personalized watchlist. Users can add movies they want to watch, mark them as watched/unwatched, and view details for each movie. The app will integrate with a backend for persistent storage, making it easy to access and update their list anytime.

## âš¡ Features Breakdown

### Phase 1 (Essential - Start Here)
- [ ] **Movie Search & Add** - Add a search feature to find movies and add them to the watchlist using a movie API (e.g., TMDB API).
- [ ] **Watchlist Management** - Enable users to add, delete, or mark movies as watched/unwatched.
- [ ] **Persistent Storage** - Integrate with Firebase or a custom API to save watchlist data so it persists across sessions.
- [ ] **Basic Watchlist UI** - Display a list of movies in the watchlist, differentiating between watched and unwatched.

### Phase 2 (Near Future - Next 2-4 weeks)
- [ ] **Movie Details Page** - Provide a detailed view for each movie, including release date, rating, and synopsis.
- [ ] **Filter & Sort Options** - Allow users to filter movies by status (watched/unwatched) and sort by title or date added.
- [ ] **User Authentication** - Add user login with Firebase Authentication to keep individual user watchlists separate.
- [ ] **Notifications & Reminders** - Notify users about upcoming movie releases theyâ€™ve added to the watchlist.
- [ ] **Basic Recommendations** - Suggest similar movies based on the current watchlist.

### Phase 3 (Future Expansion)
- [ ] **Movie Trailers** - Embed trailers or links to trailers for movies in the watchlist.
- [ ] **Collaborative Watchlists** - Allow users to create and share watchlists with friends.
- [ ] **Advanced Recommendations** - Offer movie recommendations based on genre preferences and watch history.
- [ ] **Customizable Watchlist Layout** - Let users customize how their watchlist is displayed (grid, list, etc.).

### Libraries to try
- [ ] **axios** - For making HTTP requests to fetch movie data from APIs.
- [ ] **Firebase** - For backend storage and authentication to persist watchlist data.
- [ ] **react-router-dom** - For handling navigation between the watchlist, movie details, and other pages.
- [ ] **moment.js** - To display release dates in a user-friendly format.
