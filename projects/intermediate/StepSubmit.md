# ðŸŽ¯ StepSubmit
> A multi-step submission form for collecting and validating user information with file upload support.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Scale: Medium
Expected timeline: 1-2 months

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Purpose
StepSubmit is a multi-step form application designed to help users submit information progressively. It incorporates file upload, validation, and management of form state to ensure a seamless experience and successful data collection. This project is ideal for learning advanced form handling techniques and data submission processes in React.

## âš¡ Features Breakdown

### Phase 1 (Essential - Start Here)
- [ ] **Step-by-Step Navigation** - Create a multi-step form structure with "Next" and "Previous" navigation.
- [ ] **Form Validation** - Add validation rules for each form step to ensure data integrity.
- [ ] **File Upload** - Implement file upload with previews for supported file types.

### Phase 2 (Near Future - Next 2-4 weeks)
- [ ] **Form State Management** - Use centralized state to store and manage form data across steps.
- [ ] **Progress Indicator** - Display form progress with a step indicator or progress bar.
- [ ] **Conditional Steps** - Allow certain steps to be shown/hidden based on previous inputs.
- [ ] **Final Submission & API Integration** - Add a submit button to send collected data and files to an API endpoint.

### Phase 3 (Future Expansion)
- [ ] **Save Draft Functionality** - Allow users to save form progress and resume later.
- [ ] **User Authentication** - Require login before submission to enable user-specific submissions.
- [ ] **File Size and Type Restrictions** - Implement validation for uploaded files based on type and size.

### Libraries to try
- [ ] **Formik** - For simplified form handling and validation.
- [ ] **Yup** - For schema-based validation rules in conjunction with Formik.
- [ ] **react-dropzone** - For handling file uploads and providing a customizable upload interface.
- [ ] **React Router** - To manage navigation between form steps.
