# ðŸŽ¯ SnapView
> An interactive photo gallery to display, organize, and explore images with filters and zoom functionality.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Scale: Medium
Expected timeline: 4-6 weeks

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Purpose
SnapView is a user-friendly photo gallery application that enables users to view, filter, and interact with images. It features a lightbox for viewing images in detail, zoom capabilities, and efficient image handling through lazy loading. The project aims to enhance skills in image optimization, dynamic filtering, and responsive layouts.
