# ðŸŽ¯ Convertify
> A real-time currency converter to simplify global transactions.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Scale: Medium
Expected timeline: 2-3 weeks

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Purpose
Convertify allows users to effortlessly convert currency values between multiple currencies using up-to-date rates from an external API. This project will involve API integration, state management, and user interface components to enhance usability.

## âš¡ Features Breakdown

### Phase 1 (Essential - Start Here)
- [ ] **Currency Input Fields** - Create input fields for entering the amount and selecting currencies for conversion.
- [ ] **API Integration** - Connect to a currency exchange API (e.g., ExchangeRate-API) to retrieve real-time exchange rates.
- [ ] **Real-Time Conversion** - Display the converted value in real-time as the user changes input or currency selection.
- [ ] **Swap Currencies** - Add a button to swap the "from" and "to" currencies.

### Phase 2 (Near Future - Next 2-4 weeks)
- [ ] **Currency Symbols and Flags** - Display country flags or symbols alongside currency codes for a better user experience.
- [ ] **Conversion History** - Keep a history of recent conversions for quick reference.
- [ ] **Favorite Currencies** - Allow users to mark frequently used currencies for quick selection.
- [ ] **Error Handling** - Display user-friendly error messages if there are issues with the API connection.

### Phase 3 (Future Expansion)
- [ ] **Graphical Trends** - Show exchange rate trends over time with a line or bar chart.
- [ ] **Offline Mode** - Cache recent rates and allow limited functionality when offline.
- [ ] **Multiple Conversions** - Enable users to convert an amount into multiple currencies simultaneously.
- [ ] **Localization** - Support multiple languages and regional settings for currency formatting.

### Libraries to try
- [ ] **axios** - For making HTTP requests to the currency exchange API.
- [ ] **react-select** - To create a user-friendly dropdown for currency selection.
- [ ] **chart.js** - For displaying historical trends of exchange rates (if implementing graph functionality).
- [ ] **react-toastify** - To show error and success notifications (e.g., API errors).
