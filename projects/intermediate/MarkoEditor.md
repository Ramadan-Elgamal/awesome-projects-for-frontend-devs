# ðŸŽ¯ MarkoEditor

## ðŸ“‹ Project Scale: Medium
Expected timeline: 2-3 weeks

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Purpose
To provide a simple and efficient Markdown editor where users can write and preview Markdown content simultaneously. This project will utilize React for state management and introduce live updates as users type, enhancing the user experience for content creators and developers alike.

## âš¡ Features Breakdown

- [ ] **Markdown Input Area** - Create a text input area for users to write Markdown.
- [ ] **Real-Time Preview** - Show a split view with a live preview of the Markdown content.

### Phase 2 (Near Future - Next 2-4 weeks)
- [ ] **Formatting Toolbar** - Add buttons for common Markdown formatting options (e.g., bold, italics, links).
- [ ] **Dark Mode** - Provide a dark theme to improve readability.
- [ ] **Full-Screen Mode** - Allow users to expand the editor to full screen for a distraction-free writing experience.
- [ ] **Local Storage** - Save the Markdown content in local storage so users don't lose their work when reloading.

### Phase 3 (Future Expansion)
- [ ] **Export as Markdown/HTML** - Add functionality to download the content as a `.md` or `.html` file.
- [ ] **Syntax Highlighting** - Highlight Markdown syntax in the editor for better readability.
- [ ] **Custom Themes** - Allow users to customize the editor's theme with different font and color options.
