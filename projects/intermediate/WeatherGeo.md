# ☀️ WeatherGeo
> Stay on top of the forecast with location-aware weather updates

## 📋 Project Scale: Medium
Expected timeline: 4-8 weeks

## 🎯 Core Purpose
WeatherGeo is a weather application that leverages the user's current location to provide real-time weather information. With a clean, intuitive interface, users can easily access the current temperature, weather conditions, and a multi-day forecast for their location.

## ⚡ Features Breakdown

### Phase 1 (Essential - Start Here)
- [ ] Detect user's current location using the browser's Geolocation API
- [ ] Fetch weather data from a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) based on user's location
- [ ] Display the current weather conditions (temperature, description, icon)
- [ ] Show a 5-day forecast with daily high/low temperatures
- [ ] Provide a way for the user to manually search for weather in other locations

### Phase 2 (Near Future - Next 2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Hourly weather forecast in addition to the daily forecast
- [ ] Weather alerts and warnings (e.g., severe storms, high winds)
- [ ] Ability to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit
- [ ] Add weather icons and animations to enhance the visual experience
- [ ] Persistent location storage (local/session storage)

### Phase 3 (Future Expansion)
- [ ] Detailed weather information (humidity, wind speed, pressure, etc.)
- [ ] Air quality and pollen count data
- [ ] Ability to add multiple locations and switch between them
- [ ] Weather-based recommendations (e.g., clothing, activities)
- [ ] Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for offline access

### Libraries to try
- [ ] @tanstack/react-query: Robust data fetching and caching
- [ ] react-icons: Comprehensive icon library
- [ ] framer-motion: Smooth UI animations
- [ ] zustand: Flexible state management
