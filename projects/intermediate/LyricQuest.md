# ðŸŽ¯ LyricQuest
> Search and discover song lyrics with metadata for your favorite tracks.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Scale: Medium
Expected timeline: 4-5 weeks

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Purpose
LyricQuest is a web application that allows users to search for song lyrics and view detailed metadata about each track. The app connects to a lyrics API, fetches and displays formatted lyrics, and handles errors gracefully. This project aims to practice skills in API integration, error handling, and responsive design for optimal user experience.
