# üå± GardenHub: Your Digital Knowledge Garden
> An interactive digital garden and personal wiki to manage and explore your knowledge with linked notes, Markdown support, and graph-based navigation.

## üìã Project Scale: Medium-High
Expected timeline: 4-6 weeks

## üéØ Core Purpose
GardenHub allows users to manage their personal knowledge by linking notes, visualizing connections, and organizing information in a bi-directional and intuitive way. Ideal for documenting thoughts, ideas, or learning materials with a dynamic, wiki-style structure.

## ‚ö° Features Breakdown

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Start Here)
- [ ] **Note Creation and Linking**: Create notes that can link to other notes using Markdown syntax (e.g., `[[Note Title]]`).
- [ ] **Markdown Support**: Implement a Markdown editor and real-time preview using libraries like **React Markdown**.
- [ ] **Simple Graph View**: Basic visualization of note connections to explore relationships between notes.

### Phase 2: Enhancing User Experience
- [ ] **Bidirectional Linking**: Display backlinks (all notes linking to the current note) to improve navigation and context.
- [ ] **Tagging and Search**: Add tags to notes for better organization, and implement a search feature for easy note retrieval.
- [ ] **Graph Visualization**: Enhance the graph view to show connections more clearly, using libraries like **D3.js** or **React-Graph-Vis**.
- [ ] **Note Versioning**: Implement a simple history log for each note, allowing users to view and restore past versions.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] **File Attachments**: Allow users to attach files or images to notes.
- [ ] **Customizable Themes**: Provide theme options for personalized styling (light/dark modes).
- [ ] **Export & Import Notes**: Add functionality to export notes as Markdown files or import them into the system.
- [ ] **Cross-Device Syncing**: Add account support to sync notes across devices.
