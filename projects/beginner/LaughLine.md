> Get a dose of humor with a random joke at every click!

## ðŸ“‹ Project Scale: Small
Expected timeline: 1-2 weeks

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Purpose
A lighthearted app that fetches a random joke from an external API and displays it on the screen. Users can enjoy fresh jokes with each click, introducing them to API fetching and data rendering in React.

## âš¡ Features Breakdown

### Phase 1 (Essential - Start Here)
- [ ] **Fetch Random Joke** - Use an API like JokeAPI to fetch a random joke on button click.
- [ ] **Display Joke** - Show the joke text clearly on the screen.
- [ ] **Loading State** - Display a loading message or spinner while the joke is being fetched.

### Phase 2 (Near Future - Next 2-4 weeks)
- [ ] **Error Handling** - Show a friendly error message if the joke fetch fails.
- [ ] **Joke Categories** - Let users select categories (e.g., "Programming", "General") for a joke tailored to their interests.
- [ ] **Favorite Jokes** - Allow users to save favorite jokes and display them in a list.
- [ ] **Share Feature** - Button to share the joke text on social media or copy to clipboard.

### Phase 3 (Future Expansion)
- [ ] **Random Joke Timer** - Option to get a new joke automatically every few seconds.
- [ ] **Dark Mode** - Toggle between light and dark themes.
- [ ] **User-Submitted Jokes** - Feature to let users submit their own jokes, which are added to a local collection.

### Libraries to try
- [ ] **axios** - For easy HTTP requests (alternative to fetch).
- [ ] **react-spinners** - Simple and customizable loading spinners.
- [ ] **react-toastify** - Notifications for successful or failed API requests.
- [ ] **react-share** - For easy integration of social sharing buttons.
