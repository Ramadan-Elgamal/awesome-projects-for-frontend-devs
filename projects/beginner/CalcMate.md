# ðŸŽ¯ CalcMate
> A sleek, minimal calculator for quick and easy arithmetic calculations.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Scale: Small
Expected timeline: 1 week

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Purpose
A basic calculator app that lets users perform simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project focuses on managing user inputs and updating results dynamically with React state.

## âš¡ Features Breakdown

### Phase 1 (Essential - Start Here)
- [ ] **Basic Number Pad** - Display a number pad with digits 0-9 and basic operators (+, -, *, /).
- [ ] **Display Screen** - Show the current input and the result after an operation is performed.
- [ ] **Arithmetic Operations** - Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- [ ] **Clear Button** - Reset the input and output with a "Clear" button.

### Phase 2 (Near Future - Next 2-4 weeks)
- [ ] **Decimal Support** - Allow users to enter decimal numbers.
- [ ] **Backspace Button** - Add a button to delete the last input character.
- [ ] **Keyboard Support** - Enable using the keyboard for input, improving accessibility.
- [ ] **Error Handling** - Display error messages for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).

### Phase 3 (Future Expansion)
- [ ] **Memory Functions** - Add memory store, recall, and clear buttons for storing recent calculations.
- [ ] **Scientific Functions** - Add buttons for advanced functions like square root and percentage.
- [ ] **History Display** - Show a list of past calculations below the calculator.

### Libraries to try
- [ ] **classnames** - For conditional class names (e.g., active button styling).
- [ ] **mathjs** - For handling complex calculations or additional mathematical functions.
- [ ] **react-hotkeys** - To manage custom keyboard shortcuts for various calculator functions.
- [ ] **styled-components** - For component-level styling and customizing the calculator theme.
