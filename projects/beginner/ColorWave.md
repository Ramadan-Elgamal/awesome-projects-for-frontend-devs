### Phase 2 (Near Future - Next 2-4 weeks)
- [ ] **Custom Color Input** - Allow users to add custom colors to the array.
- [ ] **Color Transition Effect** - Smooth transition effect when the background changes color.
- [ ] **Copy Color Code** - Button to copy the current color code to the clipboard.
