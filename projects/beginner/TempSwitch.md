# ðŸŽ¯ TempSwitch
> Instantly convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit!

## ðŸ“‹ Project Scale: Small
Expected timeline: 1 week

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Purpose
A temperature conversion app that allows users to easily convert values between Celsius and Fahrenheit. This project will demonstrate state management in React for real-time calculations and handling user inputs.

## âš¡ Features Breakdown

### Phase 1 (Essential - Start Here)
- [ ] **Input Field** - Create an input field for users to enter the temperature value.
- [ ] **Conversion Toggle** - Add a toggle button or dropdown to select either "Celsius to Fahrenheit" or "Fahrenheit to Celsius" conversion.
- [ ] **Display Result** - Show the converted temperature instantly as the input changes.
- [ ] **Clear Button** - Include a button to reset the input and output fields.

### Phase 2 (Near Future - Next 2-4 weeks)
- [ ] **Bi-directional Conversion** - Allow users to input values in either Celsius or Fahrenheit and switch between the two automatically.
- [ ] **Responsive Design** - Ensure the app looks good on both mobile and desktop.
- [ ] **Error Handling** - Display a message if the user inputs invalid data (e.g., non-numeric values).
- [ ] **Rounding Option** - Add an option to round the converted temperature to the nearest whole number or one decimal place.

### Phase 3 (Future Expansion)
- [ ] **Kelvin Conversion** - Allow conversions to and from Kelvin for a more versatile temperature tool.
- [ ] **History of Conversions** - Show a list of past conversions with the date and time.
- [ ] **Dark Mode** - Provide a dark mode for better usability in low-light settings.

### Libraries to try
- [ ] **classnames** - Manage conditional classes for different conversion modes and error handling.
- [ ] **react-bootstrap** - Style components with a responsive layout and easy-to-use forms.
- [ ] **react-switch** - For an attractive and functional toggle switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- [ ] **styled-components** - Add a unique, theme-friendly design with component-level styles.
