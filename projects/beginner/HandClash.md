# ðŸŽ¯ Hand Clash
> A classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game with smooth animations and real-time score tracking.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Scale: Small
Expected timeline: 1-2 weeks

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Purpose
Hand Clash is a fun, interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game that challenges users with quick gameplay and animations. This project will help practice React state management and logic for implementing game algorithms while adding a visual edge through animations.

## âš¡ Features Breakdown

### Phase 1 (Essential - Start Here)
- [ ] **Game Logic** - Implement core Rock, Paper, Scissors game rules and determine the winner.
- [ ] **Player Selection** - Allow players to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors with buttons or icons.
- [ ] **Basic Score Tracker** - Display and update scores for each round.

### Phase 2 (Near Future - Next 1-2 weeks)
- [ ] **Game History** - Track and display a history of previous rounds with results.
- [ ] **Smooth Animations** - Add animations for player choices and result reveal (e.g., fading, sliding).
- [ ] **Reset Game** - Implement a reset button to start a new game session and clear scores/history.

### Phase 3 (Future Expansion)
- [ ] **Opponent Difficulty** - Add difficulty levels by adjusting AI randomness (Easy, Medium, Hard).
- [ ] **Leaderboard** - Display a leaderboard showing the best scores or streaks.
- [ ] **Multiplayer Mode** - Implement a two-player mode for users to play against each other.

### Libraries to try
- [ ] **React Spring** - For animations and transitions in React.
- [ ] **Framer Motion** - Another great library for handling animations with ease.
- [ ] **Redux or Zustand** - For state management if game logic grows more complex.
- [ ] **uuid** - To generate unique IDs for game history records.

## ðŸ“š Implementation Resources
- [ ] [React Spring documentation](https://www.react-spring.dev/docs) - For implementing animations.
- [ ] [Framer Motion documentation](https://www.framer.com/docs/) - Another option for adding dynamic animations.
- [ ] [uuid documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) - For managing unique keys for game history.
