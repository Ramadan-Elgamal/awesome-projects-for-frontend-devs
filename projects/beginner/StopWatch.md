# ðŸŽ¯ Stopwatch 
> A sleek, minimalist stopwatch app to track time with essential controls.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Scale: Small
Expected timeline: 1-2 weeks

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Purpose
A simple stopwatch that allows users to start, stop, and reset the timer with clear, easy-to-read time display. The stopwatch will use React state to track and display time in real-time.

## âš¡ Features Breakdown

### Phase 1 (Essential - Start Here)
- [ ] **Start/Stop Timer** - Button to start and stop the timer, using React state to track time.
- [ ] **Reset Timer** - Reset the timer to zero with a single click.
- [ ] **Display Time** - Show time in a `00:00:00` format (hours:minutes:seconds).

### Phase 2 (Near Future - Next 2-4 weeks)
- [ ] **Lap Functionality** - Capture and display lap times.
- [ ] **Interval Adjustment** - Allow users to adjust timer intervals (1s, 0.1s).
- [ ] **Color Customization** - Add options to change display color.
- [ ] **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Enable "space" for start/stop, "r" for reset.

### Phase 3 (Future Expansion)
- [ ] **Save Laps** - Store lap times in local storage.
- [ ] **Dark Mode** - Toggle between light and dark themes.
- [ ] **Analytics Dashboard** - Simple summary of timer usage (e.g., total time tracked).

### Libraries to try
- [ ] **react-use** - Utility hooks (for managing intervals).
- [ ] **classnames** - For dynamic class handling in styling.
- [ ] **dayjs** - Lightweight library for date/time formatting (optional for time display).
- [ ] **styled-components** - Component-based styling (for theme customization).
