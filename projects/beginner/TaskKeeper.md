# ðŸŽ¯ TaskKeeper
> A to-do list app that remembers your tasks even after you close the page!

## ðŸ“‹ Project Scale: Small
Expected timeline: 1-2 weeks

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Purpose
A to-do list app that allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete, with all tasks stored in local storage for data persistence. This project will enhance React state management skills and introduce integration with local storage.

## âš¡ Features Breakdown

### Phase 1 (Essential - Start Here)
- [ ] **Add Task** - Let users add new tasks with a title and optional description.
- [ ] **Display Tasks** - Show the list of tasks with options to mark them as complete/incomplete.
- [ ] **Delete Task** - Allow users to delete individual tasks.
- [ ] **Persist Tasks in Local Storage** - Save the tasks to local storage and load them on page refresh.

### Phase 2 (Near Future - Next 2-4 weeks)
- [ ] **Edit Task** - Enable users to edit the title and description of existing tasks.
- [ ] **Filter Tasks** - Add filters to show All, Completed, and Incomplete tasks.
- [ ] **Search Tasks** - Implement a search bar to quickly find tasks by title.
- [ ] **Clear All Tasks** - Provide an option to clear all tasks at once.

### Phase 3 (Future Expansion)
- [ ] **Due Dates** - Add due dates to tasks and sort them by upcoming deadlines.
- [ ] **Category/Label Support** - Let users categorize tasks with labels (e.g., "Work", "Personal").
- [ ] **Dark Mode** - Add a dark theme for user comfort in low-light settings.

### Libraries to try
- [ ] **uuid** - Generate unique IDs for each task.
- [ ] **classnames** - Handle dynamic classes for styling completed/incomplete tasks.
- [ ] **react-toastify** - Show user notifications (e.g., "Task added", "Task deleted").
- [ ] **styled-components** - For custom styling and themed designs, especially if dark mode is implemented.
